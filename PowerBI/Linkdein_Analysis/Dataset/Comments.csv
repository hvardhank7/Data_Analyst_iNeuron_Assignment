* two kinds of scaling :-
i) Standarised Scaling, it's value lie BTW - 3 to 3
ii) Normalised scaling, it's value BTW - 1 to +1

*this model is known as KNN model
* it can be used for small data set only because of it slowly execution method.
* behind the scene they make a graph which generally divide various categories, this can be treated as best fit line for non-linear data 
* In this method we have to provide the number of neighbors mainly, it is good to give and odd no. for better result
* The KNN uses Euclidean distance formula which is same as distance formula which we have studied in 10 class.
* to import this we use from sklearn. neighbours import KneighboorsClassifier to use KNN"

* we can create our own model using pretrained model by freezing the various layer and adding new layer for our model, this is known as transfer learning

*  Importance of feature selection and real data is important for prediction of anything
* Two approaches to select feature :-
    a) manual :- domain knowledge is necessary

The filter have two basic techniques which we can use to select features i. e., correlation (BTW - 1 to 1) and constant features
